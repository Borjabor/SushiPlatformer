# SushiPlatformer
 Short platformer made with three other people as a class project

This was my first more complete game made. My role in the team was as one of the programmers, having taken care of most the gameplay scripting. The character controller was the part I was most proud of. 

All of the art assets are custom made, by our artist of the team. Most of the SFX are from freesound, and a few were recorded by myself.
